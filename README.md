The-C-Programming-Language--2nd-ed-
===================================

By Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie


This is where I will be keeping the programs I write as I go through this book.
I am a novice programmer, so if you're looking for ideas on how to solve a problem,
this is probably not the best place to look.
Aside from that, enjoy.
